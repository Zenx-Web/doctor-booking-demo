This is a no-build React + Tailwind static prototype you can open directly in a browser to demo slot-wise appointment booking. It uses CDN React and in-browser Babel for speed. Later we can migrate to a proper Next.js project.

How to run
- Double-click `index.html` or open it with your browser.
- No Node.js required.

What‚Äôs included
- Slot-wise booking UI: pick a service, date, and an available time slot.
- Patient details form.
- Summary panel and a mock submit action.
- Tailwind styling via CDN.

Next steps (when ready)
- Migrate to Next.js (React) with Tailwind and TypeScript.
- Add backend APIs for availability, booking, payments, and notifications.
- Integrate Stripe for payments; Resend/SendGrid for email; Twilio for SMS.
- Implement admin dashboard for the doctor to manage availability and appointments.
